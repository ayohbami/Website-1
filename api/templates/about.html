<p>
  My Journey to Becoming a 
  <strong class="bg-dark rounded">Technical Creative</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Hello, I'm
  <strong>"Bami"</strong>, an aspiring Network Technician with a passion for both technology and creativity. My path to this point has been anything but conventional.
</p>

<p>
  With a BA in Communications, I began my career on two parallel tracks: one as a technical support representative, assisting clients with hardware and software issues, and the other as a creative freelancer. 
  While I was passionate about both fields, I struggled to find a role that truly combined my technical problem-solving skills with my creative mindset. 
  Over time, however, I became increasingly drawn to the dynamic worlds of Networking and Web Development.
</p>
<p>
  With a natural ability to analyze complex systems, solve problems, and design intuitive experiences, I knew this field was the right fit for me. 
  However, without formal education in tech at the time, I initially focused on my creative career.
</p>
<p>
  By my mid-20s, I had taken a role as an editor at a VFX studio, hoping to further immerse myself in the creative industry. 
  Yet, I found myself more fascinated by the technical aspects of the job. After two years, I realized it was time to return to my technical roots
</p>
<p>
  Determined to pivot into Networking and Web Development, I trained in Python and HTML, working on personal projects to build my skills. 
  Currently, I am pursuing a CompTIA A+ certification to further solidify my technical foundation, with the goal of stepping into a role as a Network Technician.
